# 06-Juicy-Breakout

This is my rendition of a recreation of elements from the 2012 GDC presentation "Juice it or Lose it". While technically only adding onto an existing game frame within GODOT, this project is valuable experience in coding and creating various particle, trauma, rotation, trace, and other effects onto future projects created in GODOT.

WARNING: This damn thing is loud, louder than I'd personally like anyway. I recommend having your volume mixer at the ready, or have your speakers on low just in case.

Here is a rough list of all of the featurs I have changed from the general breakout/pong simulator it was:

- Changed colors of Paddle, Ball, and Tiles.
- Animated entry of Paddle and Tiles into frame, randomizing the Tiles' entry.
- Added Squeeze and Stretch to the Paddle
- Added a Wobble to the Ball
- Added a color shift to the Ball upon impact with Tiles
- Added Shake to the Tiles when the Ball hits them or the Paddle.
- Added Total Shake to Camera upon Ball hitting Walls, at a stronger frequency.
- Added sound effects for each collision
- Added music. Loud but nice.
- Added Particles when a Tile is hit
- Added Death Animation to Tiles
- Added Rotation to Tile Death Animation
- Added a Dissappear to Tile Death Animation
- Added Particles when the Ball bounces off the Paddle
- Added a Comet/Particle Trail to the Ball
- Added a Background

{Unexpectedly made a pong-breakout into a bank-robbery-breakout.}
[Refused to add Eyes or Mouth to the Paddle. That's just a little too weird for me.]
